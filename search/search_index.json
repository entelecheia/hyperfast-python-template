It is hyperfast in the sense that the template itself is converted into a Python project in the blink of an eye. It is also hyperfast in the sense that it helps you jump start your project with the best practices in the Python community. Quickstart There are three ways to use this project: Use Hyperfast Python Template to create a new repository Use Copier to create a project to your local machine directly Inject Hyperfast Python Template into an existing project I.
